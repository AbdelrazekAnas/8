        <h1>I Love You, Fero</h1>
        <p>For my last breath goes out of me. Today is the best day ever. This day that I see your streak and fall in love with you, I said to myself, "She is my everything. She is my smile, my eyes. I trust her with everything before I see you." I love every second I spend with you. I love your voice, your eyes. I love you like the first time I saw you. I love to spend time with you. I love your laugh. Everything I do, I love it because of you.</p>
        <p class="highlight">You are the best girl in my life. Not just my lover, you are my family, you are my home.</p>
        <p>2 years have ended quickly, but I still love everything about you. I don't forget you because you are in my heart always. <span class="highlight">18/8</span> is the best date in my life. Before that, <span class="highlight">13/4/2005</span> is the date of birth of my princess.</p>
